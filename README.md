# 🎬 VegaMovies – Movie & TV Streaming Info Web App

VegaMovies is a fully responsive movie and TV show browsing application built with **React** and **TailwindCSS**.  
The app fetches real-time data from an external movie API and displays trending, popular, top-rated, and upcoming movies and shows.  
Users can also switch between Movie and TV categories, watch trailers, search content, and load results with smooth infinite scrolling.

> ⚠️ **Important:** The API used in this project is restricted/banned in India.
